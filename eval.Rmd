**Evaluation:**

This projectâ€™s classifiers were evaluated using the test loss and test accuracy of the models. The test set and training set were split preemptively, and validation accuracy was used for hyperparameter tuning. These accuracy and loss values can be seen in the results section below.

**Results:**

Monocolor Color Classification:
Test Loss: 1.531
Test Accuracy: 41.026

Monocolor Type Classification:
Test Loss: 2.284
Test Accuracy: 33.396

Dualcolor Color Classification:
Test Loss: 1.933
Test Accuracy: 36.945

Dualcolor Type Classification:
Test Loss: 2.222
Test Accuracy: 35.278
