Magic the Gathering (MTG) is a game featuring a large array of illustrated cards. This cards also feature a variety of mechanical features. By labelling the card illustration using these mechanical features a labelled dataset can be created. The aim of this project is to leverage this new dataset to create classifiers for various novel mechanical features of these cards. These classifiers can be used to aid in top-down design () from non-MTG works of art and investigating the convolutional filters generated by these classifiers can give insights into the art direction of various card types in MTG.
