MTG is a game featuring a large array of illustrated cards. These cards also feature a variety of mechanical features. By labelling the card illustration using these mechanical features a labelled dataset can be created. The aim of this project is to leverage this new dataset to create classifiers for various novel mechanical features of these cards. These classifiers can be used to aid in top-down design (Card designs inspired by art or other media rather than mechanical intent) from non-MTG works of art and can give insights into the art direction of various card types in MTG.
