title: "Further Investigation"
---

First, there are a few things that I planned to explore in my initial proposal that had to be cut due to time constraints. I would have liked to develop a GAN to generate new MTG art as well as extract convolutional filters from the network to gain insight into the defining characteristics of different mechanical features.

There are also some directions for further investigation that presented themselves during development of the model. One of possible avenues of investigation would be into na√Øve alternatives to my current deep learning approach. One concern that I had during development was whether there was a significant correlation between the color profile of cards art and their mechanical color. I think it would be interesting to construct a model that takes the average color of a card art and classifies only based on that and see how the results compare to my model.
